    # The Ansible SDK creates a "_kiali_io_kiali" variable that
    # mimics the Kiali CR but maintains camelCase in key names.
    # This will only be useful for certain cases (e.g. when
    # tolerances or affinity are specified) so most times you
    # can run with this empty (but it has to be defined).
