# kiali_cr.yaml
#
# This is a fully documented Kiali custom resource yaml file.
# It can be used to tell the Kiali Operator to install Kiali.
#
# This is actually an empty Kiali CR, however, it provides
# documentation on all available settings.
# In each documented section, you will see a "---" marker;
# below that marker you will see the names of the settings along
# with their default values. If the setting is not defined by
# default, its name will be prefixed with "#".

#
# A list of additional details that Kiali will look for in annotations and display, for every workloads and services, in their respective details pages.
# It can typically be used to inject some CI meta-data or documentation links into Kiali views.
# Each item in the list is an object with "annotation", "title" and "icon_annotation" fields to indicate which annotation Kiali needs to look for, and how it should be displayed.
# "icon_annotation" is optional and would display an icon next to the text.
# At the moment, the value of the icon annotation can only be one of "rest", "grpc" or "graphql", or be ignored.
# For example, this config:
#    - annotation: "my-domain/api-documentation"
#      icon_annotation: "my-domain/api-type"
#      title: "API Documentation"
#    - annotation: "my-domain/gitsha"
#      title: "GIT Commit"
# would make Kiali recognize these annotations in a service or a workload definition (Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.) to display the appropriate link and text:
#    annotations:
#      my-domain/api-documentation: http://link/to/my/doc

# The version of Kiali to install. This is a named version or product name.

# below for additional details. But in short, this version setting will
# dictate which version of the Kiali image will be deployed by default.
# Note that if you explicitly set deployment.image_name and/or
# deployment.image_version you are responsible for ensuring those settings
# are compatible with this setting (i.e. the Kiali image must be compatible
# with the rest of the configuration and resources the operator will install).
#
# The currently allowed values for this setting are:
#   "default", "v1.0", "v1.12"

# Refer to this file to see where these values are defined in the master branch:

#  external_services:

# authenticate with the external services. Credentials used to authenticate Kiali to those external services can
# be defined in the "auth.password" and "auth.token" values within the "auth" sub-section.
# Because these are sensitive values, you may not want to declare the actual credentials here in the Kiali CR. In
# this case, you may store the actual password or token string in a Kubernetes secret. If you do, you need to
# set the "auth.password" or "auth.token" to a value in the format "secret:<secretName>:<secretKey>" where
# "<secretName>" is the name of the secret object that Kiali can access, and <secretKey> is the name of the key
# within the named secret that contains the actual password or token string. For example, if Grafana requires a
# password, you can store that password in a secret named "myGrafanaCredentials" in a key named "myGrafanaPw".
# In this case, you would set "external_services.grafana.auth.password" to "secret:myGrafanaCredentials:myGrafanaPw".
