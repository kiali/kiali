# kiali_cr.yaml
#
# This is a fully documented Kiali custom resource yaml file.
# It can be used to tell the Kiali Operator to install Kiali.
#
# This is actually an empty Kiali CR, however, it provides
# documentation on all available settings.
# In each documented section, you will see a "---" marker;
# below that marker you will see the names of the settings along
# with their default values. If the setting is not defined by
# default, its name will be prefixed with "#".

# 'exclude' is optional takes an list of namespace/projects to be excluded from the list

# explicit namespace access.
#
# 'label_selector' is optional and takes a string value of a Kubernetes label selector
# (e.g. "myLabel=myValue") which is used when fetching the list of available namespaces.
# This does not affect explicit namespace access.

# Another example would be if the deployment.service_type is set to "ExternalName" you will need to configure
