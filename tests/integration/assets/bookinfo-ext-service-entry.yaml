##########
# This creates a simulated external service for the ratings bookinfo service such that
# when the reviews service requests ratings from the ratings service, that request will
# go out to an "external service outside of the mesh" to obtain the ratings.
#
# The ServiceEntry defines this external service.
#
# The VirtualService will route traffic to either the internal ratings-v1 service OR
# this new external ratings-v1 service (or both depending on how you set the weights).
#
# To create this simulated external ratings-v1 service, you must run a ratings service
# youself by executing this command:
#
#   $ docker run -t -i --network=host istio/examples-bookinfo-ratings-v1
#
# At this point, you have a ratings service running outside of your local cluster bound
# to your host's IP on port 9080.
#
# IMPORTANT! Before creating the Istio objects in the next step, you MUST edit this file,
# particularly the ServiceEntry's spec.endpoints.address. Change this IP to your own
# machine's host IP. Otherwise, when the bookinfo's reviews service tries to connect to
# this external service it will fail to connect.
#
# At this point you can use kubectl or oc to create these objects. For example:
#
#   $ oc apply -n bookinfo -f bookinfo-ext-service-entry.yaml
#
# After you create these Istio objects, look in Kiali's bookinfo graph between the
# reviews and ratings services to see this new traffic going to the external service.
