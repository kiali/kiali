  "answer": "You've hit on a very common scenario. My check of the mesh confirms that there **is** traffic flowing to and from the `reviews-v2` workload over the last 5 minutes (at a rate of about 0.35 requests/sec).\n\nThis means the most likely reason your graph is empty is because of the **time duration** selected in the Kiali user interface.\n\nKiali pages often default to a very short time window, like \"Last 1 minute\". If the traffic is intermittent, it's possible no requests occurred in the specific 1-minute window you were viewing.\n\n**Please try this:**\n\nAt the top of the Kiali page, find the **time range dropdown** (it will say something like \"Last 1m\") and change it to **\"Last 5m\"** or **\"Last 10m\"**.\n\nThe graph should then populate with the traffic data that I can see from my end. Also, ensure the refresh interval next to it is not set to \"Paused\"."
