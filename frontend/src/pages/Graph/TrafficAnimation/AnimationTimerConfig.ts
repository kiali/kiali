// Some information about the mathematical problem here:
// We try to project a set of RATE values from an upper-unbounded interval [0, +Inf] to a set of TIMER DELAY values in
//    a bounded interval [40ms, 5000ms] (arbitrary bounds).
// TIMER DELAY is the delay for dots generation in the animation. The lower it is, the more dots there are.
//
// The constraints are:
// - We'd like the relation to be inversely proportional: if RATE 1 is twice as big as RATE 2, DELAY 1 must be half of DELAY 2.
// - The animations should be quite representative of volumetry both _relatively_ and _absolutely_: _relatively_ is the
//    previous constraint (edges compared to each other); but _absolutely_ is another thing: regardless edges compared to
//    each other, we should have a notion of low and high traffic.
//
// To better understand the issue, we can imagine two rates R1 = 0.001 rps and R2 = 0.1 rps. R2 should have 100 times more
//    dots than R1. So it's likely to be "crowded", and looks like a high volumetry if we only consider the relative
//    relationships. But thinking in absolute, 0.1 rps is small, it shouldn't be crowded.
