Feature: Kiali Overview page

  User opens the Overview page and see the demo "error-rates" namespaces.

  Health indicators in overview page
  Kiali is capable of calculating the health of services in the mesh/cluster
  using several data sources like workload availability and errors in traffic.
  Kiali offers health status at different levels of granularity: from namespace
  level, to the individual pod. In the overview page, health indicators have
  namespace level and app level granularity.

  Background:
    Given user is at administrator perspective
    And user is at the "overview" page

  Scenario: See "alpha" and "beta" namespaces
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace card
    And user does not see any cluster badge in the "alpha" namespace card
    And user sees the "beta" namespace card
    And user does not see any cluster badge in the "beta" namespace card

  Scenario: Doesn't see a "bad" namespace
    Then user doesn't see the "bad" namespace card

  Scenario: Select the COMPACT view
    When user clicks in the "COMPACT" view
    Then user sees a "COMPACT" "alpha" namespace

  Scenario: Select the EXPAND view
    When user clicks in the "EXPAND" view
    Then user sees a "EXPAND" "beta" namespace

  Scenario: Select the LIST view
    When user clicks in the "LIST" view
    Then user sees a "LIST" "beta" namespace
    And the "Cluster" column "disappears"

  Scenario: Filter by namespace
    When user filters "alpha" namespace
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace card
    And user doesn't see the "beta" namespace card

  Scenario: Sort by name
    When user filters "alpha" namespace
    And user filters "beta" namespace
    And user sorts by name desc
    Then user sees the "beta,alpha" namespace list

  Scenario: Health for Apps
    When user selects Health for "Apps"
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace with "Applications"

  Scenario: Health for Workloads
    When user selects Health for "Workloads"
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace with "Workloads"

  Scenario: Health for Services
    When user selects Health for "Services"
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace with "Services"

  @error-rates-app
  Scenario: Last 10 minutes
    When user selects "Last 10m" time range
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace with "inbound" traffic "10m"

  @error-rates-app
  Scenario: Last 10 minutes Outbound traffic
    When user selects "Last 10m" time range
    And user selects "Outbound" traffic direction
    Then user sees the "alpha" namespace with "outbound" traffic "10m"

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: The healthy status of a logical mesh application is reported in the overview of a namespace
    Given a healthy application in the cluster
    When I fetch the overview of the cluster
    Then there should be a "healthy" application indicator in the namespace
    And the "healthy" application indicator should list the application

  @sleep-app-scaleup-after
  Scenario: The idle status of a logical mesh application is reported in the overview of a namespace

  Scenario: The failing status of a logical mesh application is reported in the overview of a namespace
    Given a failing application in the mesh
    When I fetch the overview of the cluster

    And the "failure" application indicator should list the application

  @error-rates-app
  @skip-lpinterop
  Scenario: The degraded status of a logical mesh application is reported in the overview of a namespace
    Given a degraded application in the mesh
    When I fetch the overview of the cluster
    Then there should be a "degraded" application indicator in the namespace
    And the "degraded" application indicator should list the application

  @error-rates-app
  Scenario: The Istio panel should be visible in the control panel
    Then user sees the "istio-system" namespace card
