    Given user is at administrator perspective

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Actions in kebab menu of the side panel for a service node with existing traffic routing
    Given user graphs "bookinfo" namespaces
    And user clicks the "productpage" "service" node
    And no cluster badge for the "graph side panel" should be visible
    And user opens the kebab menu of the graph side panel
    And user clicks the "delete_traffic_routing" item of the kebab menu of the graph side panel
    Then user should see the confirmation dialog to delete all traffic routing

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario Outline: Ability to launch <action> wizard from graph side panel
    Given user graphs "bookinfo" namespaces
    And user clicks the "reviews" "service" node
    And no cluster badge for the "graph side panel" should be visible
    And user opens the kebab menu of the graph side panel
    When user clicks the "<action>" item of the kebab menu of the graph side panel
    Then user should see the "<action>" wizard

    Examples:
      | action               |
      | traffic_shifting     |
      | tcp_traffic_shifting |
      | request_routing      |
      | fault_injection      |
      | request_timeouts     |

  Scenario: Actions in kebab menu of the side panel for a service node with existing traffic routing
    Given user graphs "bookinfo" namespaces
    And there is traffic routing for the "ratings" service in the "bookinfo" namespace and in the "west" cluster
    And user clicks the "ratings" service node in the "bookinfo" namespace in the "west" cluster
    And the side panel links should contain a "clusterName=west" parameter
    And "west" cluster badge for the graph side panel should be visible
    And user opens the kebab menu of the graph side panel
    And user clicks the "delete_traffic_routing" item of the kebab menu of the graph side panel
    Then user should see the confirmation dialog to delete all traffic routing
    When user chooses to delete the routing
    And user is at the "istio" list page
    Then user does not see traffic routing objects for the "ratings" service in the "bookinfo" namespace in the "west" cluster

    When user graphs "bookinfo" namespaces
    And user opens the context menu of the "ratings" service node on the "west" cluster
    And user clicks the "request_routing" action of the context menu
    Then user should see the "request_routing" wizard
