Feature: Kiali Mesh page

  User opens the Mesh page with bookinfo deployed

  Background:
    Given user is at administrator perspective
    And user is at the "mesh" page

# NOTE: Mesh Find/Hide has its own feature file

  Scenario: Open mesh Tour
    When user opens mesh tour
    Then user "sees" mesh tour

  Scenario: Close mesh Tour
    When user opens mesh tour
    And user closes mesh tour
    Then user "does not see" mesh tour

  Scenario: See mesh
    When user sees mesh side panel
    Then user sees expected mesh infra

  Scenario: Test istiod
    When user selects mesh node with label "istiod"
    Then user sees control plane side panel

  Scenario: Grafana Infra
    When user selects mesh node with label "Grafana"
    Then user sees "Grafana" node side panel

  Scenario: Jaeger Infra
    When user selects mesh node with label "jaeger"
    Then user sees "jaeger" node side panel

  Scenario: Prometheus Infra
    When user selects mesh node with label "Prometheus"
    Then user sees "Prometheus" node side panel

  Scenario: Test DataPlane
    When user selects mesh node with label "Data Plane"
    Then user sees data plane side panel

  Scenario: Test Cluster
    When user selects cluster mesh node
    Then user sees cluster side panel

  Scenario: Test istio-system
    When user selects mesh node with label "istio-system"
    Then user sees "istio-system" namespace side panel

  @skip-ossmc

    And user clicks on Help Button
    And user clicks on About Button
    Then user see the "mesh" link

  @multi-cluster
  Scenario: Primary-remote: see one dataplane for each cluster and one controlplane on primary attached to both.
    Then user sees 1 "dataplane" nodes on the "east" cluster
    And user sees 1 "dataplane" nodes on the "west" cluster
    And user sees 1 "istiod" nodes on the "east" cluster
    And user sees the istiod node connected to the dataplane nodes
  
  @multi-cluster
  @multi-primary
  Scenario: Multi-primary: see one dataplane and one controlplane for each cluster and an edge between each.
    Then user sees 1 "dataplane" nodes on the "east" cluster
    And user sees 1 "dataplane" nodes on the "west" cluster
    And user sees 1 "istiod" nodes on the "east" cluster
    And user sees 1 "istiod" nodes on the "west" cluster
