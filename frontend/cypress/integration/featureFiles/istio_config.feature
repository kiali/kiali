Feature: Kiali Istio Config page

  On the Istio Config page, an admin should see all the Istio Config objects.
  The admin should be able to filter for the Istio Config objects they are looking for
  and create new Istio objects.

  Background:
    Given user is at administrator perspective
    And user is at the "istio" list page
    And user selects the "bookinfo" namespace

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: See all Istio Config objects in the bookinfo namespace.
    Then user sees all the Istio Config objects in the bookinfo namespace
    And the "Cluster" column "disappears"
    And user sees Name information for Istio objects
    And user sees Namespace information for Istio objects
    And user sees Type information for Istio objects
    And user sees Configuration information for Istio objects

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: See all Istio Config toggles
    Then user sees all the Istio Config toggles

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Toggle Istio Config configuration toggle
    When user "unchecks" toggle "configuration"
    Then the "Configuration" column "disappears"
    When user "checks" toggle "configuration"
    Then the "Configuration" column "appears"

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Filter Istio Config objects by Istio Name
    When the user filters by "Istio Name" for "bookinfo-gateway"
    Then user only sees "bookinfo-gateway"

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Filter Istio Config objects by Type
    When the user filters by "Type" for "Gateway"
    Then only "Gateways" are visible in the "bookinfo" namespace

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Filter Istio Config objects by Valid configuration
    When the user filters by "Config" for "Valid"
    Then user sees "bookinfo-gateway"
    And user sees "bookinfo"

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Ability to create an AuthorizationPolicy object
    Then the user can create a "AuthorizationPolicy" Istio object

  Scenario: Ability to create a PeerAuthentication object
    Then the user can create a "PeerAuthentication" Istio object

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Ability to create a RequestAuthentication object
    Then the user can create a "RequestAuthentication" Istio object

  @bookinfo-app
  Scenario: Ability to create a ServiceEntry object
    Then the user can create a "ServiceEntry" Istio object

    Then the user can create a "Sidecar" Istio object

  @multi-cluster
  @multi-primary
  Scenario: See all Istio Config objects in the bookinfo namespace in the multi-cluster environment.
    Then the "Cluster" column "appears"
    And user sees all the Istio Config objects in the bookinfo namespace for the "east" cluster
    And user sees all the Istio Config objects in the bookinfo namespace for the "west" cluster
    And user sees Name information for Istio objects
    And user sees Namespace information for Istio objects
    And user sees Type information for Istio objects
    And user sees Configuration information for Istio objects
    And user sees Cluster information for Istio objects

  @multi-cluster
  Scenario: Sort list by cluster column
    When user sorts the list by column "Cluster" in "ascending" order
    Then the list is sorted by column "Cluster" in "ascending" order
    When user sorts the list by column "Cluster" in "descending" order
    Then the list is sorted by column "Cluster" in "descending" order
