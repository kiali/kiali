    And user selects the "bookinfo" namespace
    And user clicks in the "Gateway" Istio config actions
    And user sees the "Create Gateway" config wizard
    And user types "bookinfo-gateway-mc" in the "name" input
    And user adds a server to a server list
    Then the preview button should be disabled
    And user types "website.com" in the "hosts_0" input
    And user types "8080" in the "addPortNumber_0" input
    And user types "foobar" in the "addPortName_0" input
    Then the preview button should be disabled
